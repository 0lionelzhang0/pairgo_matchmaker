# Running the tournament

Players should have the option to signup via Google Form or paper signups at the Go Congress. You will need to fill out a Google Form for any paper signups so having players fill the form themselves is preferable.

Once the one-time setup instructions below are completed, you may run the matchmaker.py script at any time to update the player list.

The script will look for the Google Form responses documents and update the player list on the Google Sheets "Official XXXX Pair Go Tournament".
