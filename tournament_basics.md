In the first round, the strongest pair should face the weakest and second strongest pair should face the third strongest pair. In the second round, winners will play winners, losers play losers.

### Handicaps

### Time Settings

Traditionally, the time settings have been:
```
45 minutes with no byoyomi
```
This is also the time settings used at official pair go tournaments in Japan.

In 2022, there were concerns of players maliciously running down the opponents clock time. Therefore, the time settings were adjusted to:
```
45 minutes + 2x5 seconds byoyomi
```
The TD can decide which time settings they would prefer to use.
