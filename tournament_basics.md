## Tournament Basics

[See here for a list of the official pair go rules](http://www.worldpairgo.org/rules/index.htm)

### Tournament Format

The pair go tournament at Go Congress is a two-round event that typically takes place on Thursday evening (R1 @ 7pm, R2 @ 8:30pm). Player pairs are ordered based on the average rank of the two players, then grouped into 4 pairs per table. In the first round, the strongest pair should face the weakest and second strongest pair should face the third strongest pair. In the second round, winners will play winners, losers play losers.

### Pairing Rules

Partipants in the pair go tournament will consists of:
* Pre-made pairs (one male + one female)
* Players looking for a partner

There will most likely be more male players looking for a partner than female. In 2022, male-male pairs were created among those looking for partners in order to fill empty tables.

### Handicaps

No handicap for the top-seeded teams playing for the trip to Japan in the IAPGC qualifier. All other gamese in the main event are handicapped based on average team strength.

### Time Settings

Traditionally, the time settings have been:
```
45 minutes with no byoyomi
```
This is also the time settings used at official pair go tournaments in Japan.

In 2022, there were concerns of players maliciously running down the opponents clock time. Therefore, the time settings were adjusted to:
```
45 minutes + 2x5 seconds byoyomi
```
The TD can decide which time settings they would prefer to use.
